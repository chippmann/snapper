These are updated on every commit to main . To do so: repositories { // ... maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' } } dependencies { // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.snapper:snapper:XXX-SNAPSHOT' } You might see a number of different versioned snapshots. If we use an example: 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT is a build from the main branch, and depends on the latest tagged Jetpack Compose release (i.e. alpha03 ). 0.3.0.compose-6574163-SNAPSHOT is a build from the snapshot branch. This depends on the SNAPSHOT build of Jetpack Compose from build 6574163 . You should only use these if you are using Jetpack Compose snapshot versions (see below). Using Jetpack Compose Snapshots \u00b6 If you're using SNAPSHOT versions of the androidx.compose libraries, you might run into issues with the current stable release forcing an older version of those libraries. We publish snapshot versions of the library which depend on recent Jetpack Compose SNAPSHOT repositories. To find a recent build, look through the snapshot repository for any versions in the scheme x.x.x.compose-YYYY-SNAPSHOT (for example: 0.3.0.compose-6574163-SNAPSHOT ). The YYYY in the scheme is the snapshot build being used from AndroidX (from the example: build 6574163 ). You can then use it like so: repositories { // ... maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' } } dependencies { // Check the latest SNAPSHOT version from the link above classpath 'dev.chrisbanes.snapper:snapper:XXXX.compose-YYYYY-SNAPSHOT' } These builds are updated regularly, but there's no guarantee that we will create one for a given snapshot number. Note: you might also see versions in the scheme x.x.x.ui-YYYY-SNAPSHOT . These are the same, just using an older suffix.","title":"Using a Snapshot Version of the Library"},{"location":"using-snapshot-version/#using-a-snapshot-version-of-the-library","text":"If you would like to depend on the cutting edge version of the Snapper library, you can use the snapshot versions that are published to Sonatype OSSRH 's snapshot repository.
